# ADR-0001 Week 1 Self-Critique

## What Was Delivered

- ADR-0001 (package restructure decision record)
- `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621 metadata and src-layout
- `requirements.txt` with pinned production deps
- `src/uiao_core/` package with:
  - `__init__.py`, `__version__.py`, `config.py`
  - `models/__init__.py`, `models/canon.py` (Pydantic)
  - `cli/__init__.py`, `cli/app.py` (Typer)
  - `generators/__init__.py`, `generators/ssp.py` (stub)
  - `py.typed` (PEP 561 marker)

## What Went Well

1. **ADR-first approach works.** Writing the decision before code forced clarity.
2. **Clean package structure.** The src-layout is now pip-installable.
3. **Typed from day one.** py.typed + Pydantic models = good DX.
4. **CLI scaffolding is production-ready pattern.** Typer + Rich.

## What Needs Improvement

1. **No tests yet.** Zero pytest coverage. Week 2 must add tests/.
2. **generators/ssp.py is a stub.** The real generate_ssp.py in scripts/ was not migrated.
3. **No CI integration for the new package.** pyproject.toml exists but `pip install -e .` is not tested in CI.
4. **config.py env vars are aspirational.** UIAO_CANON_DIR etc. not used anywhere yet.
5. **Dual dependency tracking.** Both requirements.txt and pyproject.toml list deps. Should consolidate.
6. **No CHANGELOG entry.** Should document the restructure.

## Risk Assessment

- **LOW:** Package structure is conventional and reversible.
- **MEDIUM:** Old scripts/ still works, so no regression. But drift risk if both paths exist long.
- **HIGH:** No tests = no confidence gate. Must fix in Week 2.

## Week 2 Priorities

1. Add pytest + test fixtures for models and CLI
2. Migrate generate_ssp.py logic into generators/ssp.py
3. Add `pip install -e .` step to CI workflow
4. Consolidate dependency management
5. Begin ADR-0002 for validation layer
