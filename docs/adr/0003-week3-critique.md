# ADR-0003 Week 3 Self-Critique

## What Was Delivered

### Config Hardening & Dependency Consolidation
- `pyproject.toml` is now the authoritative dependency source
- `requirements.txt` converted to dev-only (pip install convenience)
- Added ruff, mypy, and pytest config sections to `pyproject.toml`
- Dev extras group (`pip install -e .[dev]`) for developer tooling

### datetime.utcnow() Retirement
- Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in SSP generator
- Settings injection into `generators/ssp.py` for configurable paths

### Generator Migration (ADR-0003 Core Deliverable)
- **docs.py**: Full port of `scripts/generate_docs.py` with Settings injection, type hints, overlay support, and configurable template mapping
- **oscal.py**: Full port of `scripts/generate_oscal.py` with OSCAL 1.0 Component Definition builder, inventory validation, and FedRAMP 20x alignment
- **poam.py**: Full port of `scripts/generate_poam.py` with intelligent gap detection (maturity levels + missing KSI evidence) and OSCAL POA&M export
- **charts.py**: Full port of `scripts/generate_charts.py` with matplotlib Agg backend, maturity radar and compliance coverage charts (USA/territories only)
- **generators/__init__.py**: Updated with all exports (`build_ssp`, `build_oscal`, `build_poam_export`, `build_docs`)

### Testing
- Added `tests/test_generators.py` with end-to-end tests covering:
  - Import verification for all 4 generator modules
  - Package-level `__init__` exports
  - OSCAL builder with empty and populated contexts
  - POA&M gap detection with empty and low-maturity data
  - SSP builder with empty context and `tmp_path` output

### CI Status
- All CI runs green (Python 3.11 + 3.12) through CI #13+
- AI Security Audit passing
- Pages deployment operational

## What Went Well
1. **Consistent pattern**: All generators follow the same architecture - Settings injection, typed signatures, configurable paths, `_get_settings()` helper
2. **CI stability**: Every commit passed CI on first try (no regressions)
3. **Rapid execution**: 4 generators + tests + init update in a single session
4. **ADR-first approach maintained**: ADR-0003 was committed before implementation

## What Needs Improvement
1. **rich_docx.py not migrated**: Deferred due to heavy `python-docx` dependency; should be Week 4 priority
2. **Legacy shims not yet added**: `scripts/` still contains original files without shims pointing to new package
3. **No lint workflow yet**: `.github/workflows/lint.yml` for ruff + mypy not created
4. **charts.py has heavy deps**: matplotlib + numpy are large; should consider making them optional extras
5. **DRY violation**: `load_context()` pattern is duplicated across oscal, poam, charts; should extract to shared utility
6. **No integration tests with real data**: Tests use empty/mock contexts; need tests against actual canon YAML

## Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Generator modules all import cleanly and CI is green
- **Medium**: `__init__.py` eagerly imports all generators, meaning jinja2/yaml must be installed; consider lazy imports
- **Medium**: No ruff/mypy enforcement yet means type errors could accumulate

## Week 4 Priorities
1. Migrate `generate_rich_docx.py` into package
2. Add thin legacy shims in `scripts/` for backward compatibility
3. Create `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (ruff check + mypy)
4. Extract shared `load_context()` into `uiao_core.generators._common`
5. Add integration tests with actual canon YAML data
6. Begin Week 4 ADR: CI/CD hardening, artifact publishing, and documentation site improvements
