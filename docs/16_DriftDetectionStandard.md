## 1. Purpose

This document formalizes the UIAO Drift Detection & Remediation Standard — the first federated drift taxonomy with severity classification, remediation contracts, and vendor accountability requirements for federal canonical data systems. It promotes and extends `PHASE5_RuntimeDriftModel.md` into the numbered canon.

---

## 2. Drift Taxonomy

UIAO defines five classes of canonical drift:

| Class | Code | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Schema Drift | `DRIFT-SCHEMA` | Claim structure deviates from canonical schema version |
| Semantic Drift | `DRIFT-SEMANTIC` | Claim value is structurally valid but semantically stale or inconsistent |
| Provenance Drift | `DRIFT-PROVENANCE` | Provenance envelope is incomplete, invalid, or chain is broken |
| Authorization Drift | `DRIFT-AUTHZ` | Claim is transmitted outside its authorized consent envelope |
| Identity Drift | `DRIFT-IDENTITY` | Claim issuer cannot be resolved to a verified identity plane object |

---

## 3. Severity Model

| Severity | Code | Definition | Auto-Remediate | SLA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | `P1` | Claim in active use; provenance or identity drift | No — halt and alert | Immediate |
| High | `P2` | Schema or semantic drift in a live claim | Yes, if deterministic | 1 hour |
| Medium | `P3` | Drift in a dormant or historical claim | Yes | 24 hours |
| Low | `P4` | Style or metadata drift; no semantic impact | Yes | 72 hours |

---

## 4. Remediation Contract

Every adapter MUST implement the following remediation contract:

```yaml
remediation_contract:
  drift_class: "{DRIFT-*}"
  severity: "{P1|P2|P3|P4}"
  detection_timestamp: "{ISO8601}"
  detected_by: "{adapter_id | workflow_id}"
  auto_remediated: true | false
  remediation_action: "halt | fix | flag | log"
  remediation_timestamp: "{ISO8601}"
  remediation_evidence: "{commit_sha or audit_record_id}"
  escalation_path: "{Canon Steward | Architecture Lead | CISO}"
```

---

## 5. Vendor Accountability Requirements

Certified UIAO adapters MUST:

- Report all drift events to the UIAO telemetry plane within 5 minutes of detection
- Maintain a 30-day drift event log accessible to the Canon Steward
- Achieve < 0.1% P1/P2 drift rate over any rolling 30-day window to maintain certification
- Provide remediation evidence for every P1 event within 24 hours

---

## 6. Compliance Mapping

| NIST Control | Drift Standard Requirement |
|---|---|
| CM-3 (Configuration Change Control) | Schema drift detection and remediation |
| SI-7 (Software Integrity) | Provenance and lineage hash verification |
| CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring) | Automated drift detection workflow |
| IR-6 (Incident Reporting) | P1/P2 escalation paths |
